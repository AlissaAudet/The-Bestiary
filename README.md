# ðŸ¦‰ The Bestiary

The Bestiary is a collaborative web platform for recording and sharing geolocated wildlife observations across Quebec. Designed for both nature enthusiasts and amateur scientists, it allows users to publish animal sightings, rate and comment on them, follow other users, and explore biodiversity data through search and filtering tools. The goal is to bridge the gap between citizen science and social networking by creating a community-driven biodiversity catalog.
